The README should also say how to use the project.
 For nouns, always start with capital letter
include a license file
Depending on the license you use, you should include the license as a header in the code, or can keep it as a separat file in the project sources
have a separate INSTALL file that gives you instructions on how to install the software for use
file names should be time-stamped if applicable
name should describe the content
Some projects keep a CHANGELOG file or release notes so users can quickly refer to that. Since there are no releases made in this project this is fine
If you decide to put the license in the code itself, you will also put your name, Copyright, year information as a comment header in the top of the file
write a guide for user of program
. Whenever any user input is fetched, some validation needs to be done
10. Reading the input could have been written as a separate function which does only one thing that is to get the required input from the user
Try to be meaningful and give good feedback to the user when writing software
It is good to separate different functionality into small functions. In the *nix philosophy, each function should do one thing and does it well
it is good to describe the input of an operation
When you split your logic into functions, you can write commentns and docstrings
you can also write test in them, or create a separate unit test file to test your functions
When doing a network call, things can fail; so, having a try catch block is helpful in this context
. It is a good practice to be consistent on what we return on success and failure from a function
 In general, it is good te separate functions that do IO and functions where you operate data with
