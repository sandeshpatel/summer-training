    "[15:16] <nisha_> !\n",
    "[15:16] <im_mohsin> dodococo, both. I have been doing Competitve programming and now getting started OSS. i think depends alot on what you enjoy. Fo me Competitve programming is fun and addictive as i  learn lot of new Algorithms and Data structures during long contest<eom>\n",
    "[15:16] <saptaks> dodococo: I think OSS gives you more exposure to know how real life softwares work. In competitive coding you do get to learn the basics and improve your logics. But in OSS you get to learn how actually things work.\n",
    "[15:16] <saptaks> In OSS you will actually get a real life scenario.\n",

    "[15:17] <Priyansh> I too missed my intro. Sorry!\n",
    "[15:17] <kushal> Priyansh, type it out now.\n",
    "[15:17] <im_mohsin> saptaks, true.. Competitve programming improves problem solving ability which might help in OSS :)\n",

    "[15:18] <dodococo> sorry\n",
    "[15:18] <sayan> Both of them are required. Contributing to open source helps know technologies, tools and build real softwares\n",

    "[15:19] <fhackdroid> sayan: your take on this ?\n",
    "[15:19] <sayan> that people/companies/other fellow open source contributors use\n",
    "[15:20] <dodococo> okay, got it. Thank you sayan saptaks im_mohsin\n",
    "[15:20] <sayan> Competitive is good, but it should be more like learning algorithms, maths and how you can use them\n",
    "[15:20] <kushal> next\n",
    "[15:20] <sayan> in real life scenarios\n",
    "[15:20] <kvy> what is this ISP. and OSS and competitive coding.\n",

    "[15:21] <bhavin192> dhairyya, no, not necessary to have public IP\n",
    "[15:21] <shankarj67> Kvy, ISP is internet service provider, mobile Sim you are using for internet in most cases\n",
    "[15:22] <sayan> because, if you don't know algorithms you might be try to solve a problem, and people might have already written good algorithm for those scenarios\n",
